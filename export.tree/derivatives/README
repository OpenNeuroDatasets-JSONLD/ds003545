JNeuro_LI_data_experiment2.xlsx contains the laterality index (LI) values for the Experiment-2 results published in Gurunandan et al. (JNeurosci, 2020).

Analysis pipeline used to acquire the laterality indices (see Gurunandan et al. 2020 for further details):

[1] Standard SPM8 routines were employed to pre-process data and get subject-level whole brain contrasts.
[2] Individual subject t-maps were masked with an inclusive "language regions" mask, and LI-toolbox was used with recommended default settings to extract laterality indices.
[3] Outlier values (>2SD) were discarded, and laterality indices were entered into the figures and statistical tests presented in the paper.

Software specifics: 
- fMRI data preprocessing and level-I analyses were carried out with SPM8 using MATLAB R2012b on a Windows machine
- the values in the excel are the direct output of LI-toolbox for SPM8 using the inclusive mask that is included in the mask/ folder

Annotations: Outlier values (>2SD) are marked in yellow. These were excluded from analyses and figures.
