Study design:

24 17-year old early sequential bilinguals underwent intensive language training in a third language, and were scanned at two time-points 3 months apart. Subjects performed semantic comprehension (reading and speech) and verbal production tasks in the MRI scanner in their native and new languages.

- Data: comprehension and production tasks from this dataset + comprehension and production tasks from a cross-sectional dataset (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003538/versions/1.0.0).
- Summary: In this work, we put together cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in a comprehensive examination of the flexibility of lateralisation, i.e. is hemispheric lateralisation of language processing fixed in early childhood or can it change with later language learning?
